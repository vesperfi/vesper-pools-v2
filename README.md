# Vesper Pools V2

Please read and get familiar with [Vesper](https://docs.vesper.finance/). This repository contains set of smart contracts and test cases of Vesper pools.

## Setup

1. Install

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/vesperfi/vesper-pools-v2.git
   cd vesper-pools-v2
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```

2. set NODE_URL in env

   ```sh
   export NODE_URL=<eth mainnet url>
   ```

3. Test

Note: These tests will fork the mainnet as required in step 3. It is not recommended to run all tests at once, but rather to specify a single file.

- Run single file

```sh
npm test test/veth-aave.js
```

- Or run them all (but some will fail, because of state modifications to the forked chain)

```sh
npm test
```

## Mainnet fork deployment

Fork mainnet using ganache

```sh
npm run fork
```

## Run test with coverage

Coverage will launch its own in-process ganache server, so all you need to run is below command.

```sh
npm run coverage
```

Coverage for one file

```
npm run coverage -- --testfiles "<<filename>>"
```

If you get heap memory error in solidity coverage then try below command
```sh
   node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/hardhat coverage --testfiles "fileName"
```
